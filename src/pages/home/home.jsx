                    Mostly all of us except the atheists beleive that God created us. Depends on which religious family you are born, you are taught by that particular faith.
                    We grow up with those beliefs and some of us practice and some doesn't.
                </p>

                <p className={styles.introP}>
                    Now if you are a guy like me than you should quite often ask yourself that why are we are practicing
                    a particular faith and how that relates to the reality or at least should have a valid meaning. If that so then you are in the right track. You can find the truth by wondering or asking about what and why you are beleiving a particular teaching and when you find the truth, then you can discover who you are, why you are here in this planet and what is the aim your life not everyone's life.

                <p className={styles.introP}>
                    It is very important that we shouldn't just follow the teachings that we were taught but to find the ultimate truth. In some religions, it is believed that there is one god and while others beleive in many. When it comes to the different types of religion, people often argue about their own religious history and beliefs. But what is so important here is the fundamentals, the pure basics of a belief.

                    I was born in a muslim orthodox family in Bangladesh. My family, relatives are practical muslims and very strict about religion. Quite often my mind used come up with different questions about the faith I was following and the differences between Islam and other religions. In 2009, I was in college studying science. One day in the evening I was watching a religious debate between Dr. Zakir Naik and a hindu guru. The debate made an impression on my mind

                <h2 className={styles.intro2H2}>What is the purpose of your life</h2>
                <p className={styles.introP}>It is very important for an individual to find out who they are and what is the purpose of their life. In most of our cases, we follow the teachings of our religious faith blindly without to realize how that make a sense in our present and after life.</p>

                <p className={styles.introP}>Most of us practice our religious faith seriously to earn a ticket to heaven. And the only way to earn this is to have the fear of the god and to earn the pleassure of the god's which forces us to follow the teachings</p>

                <p className={styles.introP}>So the first question is "Does Heaven really exist ?"</p>

                <p className={styles.introP}>
                    If yes then where is heaven, how long we will live there and most importantly what is the purpose of living in the heaven. You see the questions keep coming if we pay a little attention. Muslims and Christians believes that heaven or paradise lifetime is eternal. Now lets assume that you have entered in the heaven after your death which is still a hypothetical matter, what you will do over there.
                    And as for Islam, heaven is eternal, there are no limitations, no poverty, no one need to work as they will get everything within a couple of seconds as they desire.

                    So how long would you like to stay there.
                </p>

                <p className={styles.introP}>Frankly, I think it is rubbish why ? I give you an example, lets say that you have been given a big house with almost everything you need for unlimited amount for a luxurious life for five years and you cannot exit from that house. I guarantee that almost everybody will accept that offer without hasitation but then no one will be able to stay in that house for that long.</p>

                <p className={styles.introP}>Why? "because they have nothing to do". Without to doing anything and getting everything they want in hand without to working for it is another word is hopeless or aimless.</p>

                <p className={styles.introP}>A human being cannot live without an aim and they cannot stay in one place forever. They cannot stay without work or with work for a long period of time. That's why you see that people become mad to go to holiday after they worked for a long period of time and for those who doesn't work (Rich people) for living a life without to doing anything for a long time. So how that make sense in practical.</p>

                <p className={styles.introP}>On the other hand, in Hinduism, there is a core concept called "Moksha" which means "Having reached the highest perfection and attaining Me, the great ones never again take rebirth in this world which is transient and full of misery".</p>

                <a href='https://blog.bhaktimarga.org/7-core-tenets-of-hinduism' target="_blank" className={styles.introLink}>For more visit here</a>

                <p className={styles.introP}>
                    Hindus beleive that "Atma" or soul is part of the god and every living creature of this universe has soul. Each soul go through a process called "Samsara" which is another core concept of hinduism where a soul complete a massive lifespan containing many chapters. Each chapter is a lifetime of a different living form which is determined by the "Karma" which is another important foundation of hinduism.
                    Each lifetime a soul achieve some perfection or higher state of mind and during Samsara when a soul achieve the full perfection it complete the process and the process "Samsara" end meaning no rebirth will take place and the soul will return to the supreme god.
                </p>

                <p className={styles.introP}>So you see that the aim in life is to achieve the perfection of life not to earn the ticket to enter to the heaven which is completely illogical. And there is a final destination where a soul ends</p>
