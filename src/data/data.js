If that so then you are in the right track. You can find the truth by wondering or asking about what and why you are beleiving a particular teaching and when you find the truth, then you can discover who you are, why you are here in this planet and what is the aim your life not to follow what we have been taught.",

In some religions, it is believed that there is one god and while others beleive in many.

Quite often my mind used to come up with a different questions about the faith I was following and the differences between Islam and other religions. In 2009, I was in college studying science. One day in the evening I was watching a religious debate between Dr. Zakir Naik and a hindu guru. The debate made an impression on my mind when I heared that how they established their logic about their religions. Then I took this matter seriously and I started to read books about Islam and the more I was reading the more confusing it became as many times we are been told to do things to gain the pleassure of the god without to explain properly.",

            'Jnan Yoga: It is a spiritual practice that aims at attaining Moksha by gaining knowledge and introspection. Jnaana in sanskrit means knowledge or wisdom. A person following Jnan yog self contemplates with questions like ‘who am i ? Or What am I?’ and persues knowledge of scriptures such as Vedas and Upanishads to understand the relation between his Soul and the Supreme Soul in order to finally merge with it, thus attaining Moksha. This is the highest and most respected method to connect with God in Hinduism and requires guidence of a spiritual teacher ‘Guru’ to remain focused on the aim and to avoid getting lost in the endless oceans of knowledge and getting confused with the interpretation of the scriptures. Guru is considered to be compulsory in Jnan yoga. Below is a painting of Shri AdiGuru Shankaracharya instructing his disciples.',
            'Karma Yoga: This yoga prescribes rightful deeds as a path to attain moksha. According to Karma Yoga, performing one’s duties as an unbiased, selfless service to others for a rightful cause is a method of worship of God and is a method of attaining Moksha. Below is a picture of Shri Krishna encouraging Arjun to perform his duty by fighting against evil without getting biased by the fact that evil doers are his own brothers from his own clan thus performing a selfless service towards the human society.',
            'Bhakti yoga: Unlike general perception, Hinduism (Sanatan Dharma) is a monotheistic religion based on philosophy of omipresence of God(pantheism). It teaches that God is one and this Universe is integral to Him. The different Gods worshipped in Hinduism are personifications of the Supreme Soul (Parmatma) in different ‘modes of consciousness’ called Chetana (चेतना). A person following Bhakti Yoga devotes himself to a personification of God that matches his own consciousness and worships Him with utmost compassion to attain Moksha. Below is a painting of a 14th century Meera known for her bhakti towards Lord Krishna.',
            'One can follow any of these or all of these paths to connect with God. Hinduism is a liberal religion and also allows oneself to invent his own path to connect with God and finally merge with Him.',
            'I personally follow a vakti yoga, the yoga of devotion,  is a path that leads us directly to the heart’s deepest reservoirs of love and devotion. I hope that one day I will be free from this trap cycle and be able to merge with God.'

Muslims and Christians believes that heaven or paradise lifetime is eternal. Now lets assume that you have entered in the heaven after your death which is still a hypothetical matter, what you will do over there. And as for Islam, heaven is eternal, there are no limitations, no poverty, no one need to work as they will get everything within a couple of seconds as they desire. So how long would you like to stay there.",

I give you an example, lets say that you have been given a big house with almost everything you need for unlimited amount for a luxurious life for five years and you cannot exit from that house. I guarantee that almost everybody will accept that offer without hasitation but then no one will be able to stay in that house for that long.",

That's why you see that people become mad to go to holiday after they worked for a long period of time and for those who doesn't work (Rich people) for living a life without to doing anything for a long time. So how that make sense in practical.",
            'On the other hand, in Hinduism, there is a core concept called "Moksha" which means "Having reached the highest perfection and attaining Me, the great ones never again take rebirth in this world which is transient and full of misery".',
            'Hindus beleive that "Atma" or soul is part of the god and every living creature of this universe has soul. Each soul go through a process called "Samsara" which is another core concept of hinduism where a soul complete a massive lifespan containing many chapters. Each chapter is a lifetime of a different living form which is determined by the "Karma" which is another important foundation of hinduism. Each lifetime a soul achieve some perfection or higher state of mind and during Samsara when a soul achieve the full perfection it complete the process and the process "Samsara" end meaning no rebirth will take place and the soul will return to the supreme god.',
            'So you see that the aim in life is to achieve the perfection of life not to earn the ticket to enter to the heaven which is completely illogical. And there is a final destination where a soul ends. And talking about rewards for the work that we do are present here in this world. If we do good karma then we will be rewarded in the next life and if we do bad karma then we get te punishment in the next life.',
            'In Hinduism, dharma is the religious and moral law governing individual conduct and is one of the four ends of life. In addition to the dharma that applies to everyone (sadharana dharma)—consisting of truthfulness, non-injury, and generosity, among other virtues—there is also a specific dharma (svadharma) to be followed according to one’s class, status, and station in life. Dharma constitutes the subject matter of the Dharma-sutras, religious manuals that are the earliest source of Hindu law, and in the course of time has been extended into lengthy compilations of law, the Dharma-shastra.',
            <h2>Types of Dharma</h2>,
            'For Hindus, there is another key form of dharma. This is Sanatana dharma, which is the eternal dharma that governs all Hindus regardless of their status or caste. It is sometimes referred to as the eternal duty towards God. Therefore, Hindus in their daily lives attempt to be aware of their actions and show virtues such as patience, kindness and loyalty. Many Hindus view Sanatana dharma as a code of conduct. It is focused on God and how the community of Hindus act and conduct themselves.',
            'Sanatana dharma is different from personal dharma as it is a community-wide set of duties and virtues. It is important to note that many Hindus view Sanatana dharma and personal dharma as interchangeable. This is because by paying attention to their personal dharma, they will be living a virtuous life that demonstrates a positive code of conduct for other Hindus.',

Azad received numerous death threats from fundamentalist groups after its publication. On 27 February 2004, he became the victim of an assassination attempt by assailants armed with machetes near the campus of the University of Dhaka during the annual Ekushey Book Fair. A week prior to that assault, Delwar Hossain Sayeedi, a Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami leader and then member of the parliament, demanded in the parliament that Azad's political satire Pak Sar Jamin Saad Baad be banned and called for the application of the Blasphemy Act to the author.",

Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the first president of Bangladesh, also cancelled the citizenship of Ghulam Azam, the leader of Jamaat-e-Islami who moved to Pakistan, the Middle East and the UK. Azam first fled to Pakistan and organised an "East Pakistan Recovery Week". As information about his participation in the killing of civilians came to light "a strong groundswell of resentment against" East Pakistan JI leadership developed and Azam and Maulan Abdur Rahim were sent to Saudi Arabia.

These post-Mujibur regimes were immediately recognised by both Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, and Jamaat-e-Islami once again resumed political activities in Bangladesh. Rahman also allowed Azam to return to Bangladesh as the leader of Jamaat-e-Islami.',
            "After the end of military rule in 1990, mass protests began against Azam and Jamaat-e-Islami, who were accused by the protesters of committing war crimes. The protests were headed by Jahanara Imam, an author who lost her elder son, Shafi Imam Rumi, in the liberation war. Azam's citizenship was challenged in a case that went to the Bangladesh Supreme Court, as he held only a Pakistani passport. Absent prosecution of Azam for war crimes, the Supreme Court ruled that he had to be allowed a Bangladeshi passport and the freedom to resume his political activities.",

Then around 8'o clock UK local time they called me and gave me death threat of myself and my family. Why? because I stood against their violences and killing innocent people who did nothing to them but they killed them and destroy their lives and houses because those people didn't support their corruptions and crazy madnesses. And they call their religion a religion of peace. How peacefull was that when when they killed those innocent people who didn't vote them in the election. I would rather kill myself than to follow a religion like that.",

            "Bangladesh is still a developing country. Even though the prime minister promised to transform the country as digitalized but still now the public safety is very poor. Though the use of CCTV has started but they are very few in numbers. As there are some rapid respose system like 999 or 911 but still the response aren't fast. Criminals have ample time and opportunity to escape from the incident place after they commited a crime. Limited amount of the police and the law enforcement team compared the number of population of bangladesh still facing very difficulties to offer safety and security of the local people even in the capital city of the country and villages are far away. If the government doesn't take a seriuos action against them soon they will make the innocent and hard working people's life endangered."
